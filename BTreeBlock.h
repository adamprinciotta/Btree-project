/*
 * BTreeBlock.h - declaration of the class BTreeBlock, used as part
 * of actually implementing a B Tree.  CPS222 project 4
 *
 * An object of class BTreeBlock is used to hold an in-memory copy of
 * one block of the BTree, and provides methods for manipulating it.
 *
 * The method BTreeFile::getBlock() is used to copy a block from the
 * disk file to a Block object; and the method BTreeFile::putBlock()
 * is used to copy a Block object back to the file.
 *
 * Although a block on disk can hold only DEGREE - 1 keys and
 * associated values, and can store DEGREE block numbers of child
 * blocks (see BTreeFile.h), an in-memory copy is allowed to hold one
 * more key, value, and child than this to facilitate splitting.  Of
 * course, an over-full in-memory copy will never be read as such from
 * disk, nor can it be transferred to disk before it is split.
