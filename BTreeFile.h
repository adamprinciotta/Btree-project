/*
 * BTreeFile.h - declaration of the class BTreeFile, used as part
 * of actually implementing a B Tree.  CPS222 project 4
 *
 * This class manages a file storing BTreeBlock objects on disk.  In addition
 * to storing the blocks themselves, it stores the root block number.  It
 * also tracks which blocks are free, and provides allocateBlock and
 * deallocateBlock for getting and releasing free blocks.
 *
 * Blocks are numbered 1, 2, 3, ...  There is no block 0, so 0 has the same
 * function for a tree on disk as NULL and nullptr have for a tree in main
 * memory.
 *
 * Any variable holding a block number must be declared as type BlockNumber.
 *
 * When a new BTreeFile is created, it has no root.  The user of this
 * class must create a root node BTreeBlock, get a BlockNumber for it
 * with allocateBlock(), and use setRoot() to make it the root.
 *
 * getBlock() and putBlock() are used to read and write BTreeBlocks
 * from and to the file.
